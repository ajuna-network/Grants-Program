### Overview

**Project Name:** Substrate Asset Game Engine (SAGE)

**Tagline:** A modular, instanced Substrate framework for building blockchain-based games with reusable logic, asset handling, and developer-friendly tooling.

**Description:**
The **SAGE Game Framework** is a **modular and extensible game engine** designed to manage **on-chain game state** through an **asset-based, state-transition model**. Rather than maintaining complex game states in traditional off-chain databases or fragmented Substrate storage items, **SAGE embeds the game state directly within the assets themselves** — creating a self-contained, portable state system that lives entirely on-chain.

SAGE is designed to reduce the complexity of building blockchain games on Substrate by providing a flexible, reusable **state machine framework** with key features:
- Asset creation, mutation, trading, and nft wrapping (compatible with pallet-assets/NFT standards).
- Generic transitions for game state progression.
- Season, tournament, and leaderboard management.
- Support for modular gameplay logic, with **multiple entry points** for developers to plug in game-specific logic.
- Free to play mechanic, and Affiliation hooks for referral programs.
- Manager/admin roles to configure features dynamically.
- Account farming protection, with an achievement unlock feature system.
- Terminal UI and developer playground for quick hack & play.

SAGE evolved from the **Awesome Ajuna Avatars** project, that evolved from Bajun Network, into Big Ballz on **Ajuna Network** and available as a mobile game ([bbb.ajuna.io](https://bbb.ajuna.io)) ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ajuna.bbb)). After experiencing high complexity onboarding other projects onto AAA, we redesigned and modularized SAGE to be a **all-in one framework for future Substrate-based games**. Allowing gamedevs, to spin up a full enviroment, including a Unity template, to start develope games in seconds.

### Project Details

#### SAGE Game Framework

The SAGE Game Framework is a modular engine designed for game state management using an asset-based, state-transition model. Instead of using a traditional database, SAGE stores state directly on "assets" (e.g., game cards), and state changes are performed by executing transitions that consume and produce assets. This architecture allows for a flexible, decentralized, and extensible game design. Maintainging the full utility on the Asset it self, and allowing devs to not care for the on-chain storage, but work on the actual state transitions of the assets. SAGE Framework is not limited to games, features like assets holding balances, might open for other products, that can be created which we have to figure out. Game Devs, don't need to care for a specific and game cetric datamodel, assets can hold utilities far beyond, other benefits

##### Core Concepts

Each **asset** (such as a game character, item, or piece of equipment) is not just an object with a static set of properties; it carries its **current state**, such as its health, level, evolution status, or any other gameplay-relevant data. State changes (like upgrading an item, progressing a character, or resolving a battle) are processed through **state transitions** — pre-defined logical transformations that **consume and produce assets**.

**Reference Implementation in C#**

- **Account:**
  Represents a player or system account. Each account is identified by a unique ID and holds a balance. [Ref.C#](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SAGE/blob/master/Ajuna.SAGE.Game/Manager/AccountManager.cs)

- **Asset:**
  The fundamental game object. Assets have an owner (`OwnerId`), a collection identifier, a score, a genesis timestamp, and a data array (often referred to as DNA) that encodes various properties using compact, bit-level operations. [Ref.C#](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SAGE/blob/master/Ajuna.SAGE.Game/Manager/AssettManager.cs)

- **Balance:**
  Tracks funds for both accounts and assets. Asset-specific balances are managed separately from overall account balances. [Ref.C#](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SAGE/blob/master/Ajuna.SAGE.Game/Manager/BalanceManager.cs)

- **Transition:**
  A state change operation that is defined by:
  - A unique **Identifier** (encapsulated by an `ITransitionIdentifier`)
  - A set of **Rules** (implementing `ITransitionRule`)
  - An optional **Fee**
  - A **Transition Function** that computes new assets (the updated state) from the provided inputs

- **Engine:**
  The central component that manages accounts, assets, balances, and transitions. It relies on external providers (like a blockchain info provider) for block numbers and randomness. [Ref.C#](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SAGE/blob/master/Ajuna.SAGE.Game/Engine.cs)

##### Summary

By separating accounts, assets, balances, and transitions, the SAGE Game Framework provides a robust foundation for developing complex, asset-based games. Its modular design and use of state transitions make it highly adaptable for various game genres and mechanics.

#### What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement

This project will not provide games or apps on top of SAGE that are production-ready; all demos and apps are for demonstration purposes only.

### Ecosystem Fit

#### Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

SAGE (Substrate Asset Game Engine) fits directly into the **Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama ecosystem** by providing a **modular, asset-first framework** for building **fully on-chain games** and **game-like experiences**. It integrates seamlessly into the existing Substrate framework and the broader Polkadot application landscape, including the **Polkadot SDK for Unity**, creating an **easy and intuitive entry point for game developers** unfamiliar with blockchain development.

The **SAGE Playground repository** offers a **hack & play environment** that can be spun up locally in seconds, complete with **a Unity project template and a browser-based template**, allowing developers to experiment immediately without complex setup. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for developers interested in **on-chain gaming** on Polkadot.

#### Who is your target audience?

The primary target audiences are:

- **Parachains looking to offer gaming or asset-centric applications**.
- **Traditional game developers** (Unity, Unreal, browser-based devs) interested in integrating on-chain asset management and progression into their games.
- **dApp developers building applications where asset evolution, ownership, and composability are critical (beyond just gaming)**.

#### What need(s) does your project meet?

SAGE addresses a long-standing gap in the ecosystem: the **lack of accessible tooling for game developers** to create **on-chain games** without needing extensive Substrate, Rust, or smart contract expertise.

- **Simplified Onboarding**: By providing clear examples, templates, and ready-to-use assets, game developers can get started with **on-chain game development** without needing to understand **substrate pallets** or **complex storage handling**.
- **Asset-Centric Game Logic**: Instead of writing game logic directly in Rust or in smart contracts, developers define **how assets can transition** from state to state. This abstracts away much of the blockchain complexity.
- **Full Lifecycle Asset Management**: Developers can **track asset states, player progression, inventories**, and **in-game economies** via on-chain transitions, all without having to manually design low-level storage solutions.
- **Cross-Game Potential**: Assets created in one game can be **extended, evolved, or even reused across other games**, for that purpose, we have integrated a NFT transfer pallet, providing a NFT wrapper solution with the pallet-nfts.

#### How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence.

Our insights stem from **over three years of direct experience onboarding game developers into the Polkadot ecosystem**. Despite our own technical expertise, we encountered recurring challenges when working with **traditional game studios**. The primary obstacles included:

- **Understanding Substrate’s architecture**.
- **The need to write custom Rust code for every game mechanic**.
- **The disconnect between game design logic (in Unity/Unreal) and blockchain state management**.
- **The steep learning curve of blockchain-specific game logic (state transitions, storage, asset ownership, and evolution)**.

Multiple projects were delayed or abandoned because **the gap between traditional game development workflows and the on-chain asset lifecycle was too wide**. This feedback, combined with internal post-mortem reviews, highlighted the need for an **abstraction layer** that allows game developers to focus on **defining asset rules** instead of wrestling with blockchain complexity.

#### Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

##### Similar Projects

The **Awesome Ajuna Avatars** project built on some of the **core SAGE principles**, demonstrating **on-chain asset evolution**, **player progression tied to asset states**, and **embedded game mechanics on-chain**. However, this project was **highly tailored to a specific game** and lacked the flexibility to **onboard external developers** easily. The onboarding process for new teams was complicated, often requiring **direct involvement from our core technical team**.

##### Key Differentiation

SAGE directly addresses these limitations by:

- Providing **a generalized, reusable asset transition framework** applicable across **different games and asset types**.
- Including **pre-built templates, Unity/Browser integration**, and **a simplified local dev environment (Playground)**.
- Focusing on **developer autonomy**, allowing **traditional game developers** to design **on-chain asset logic** without needing direct blockchain expertise.
- Emphasizing **composability and modularity**, enabling assets to **evolve across multiple games** or **applications**.

#### If not, why might such a project not have been attempted?

The lack of similar projects likely stems from:

- **High complexity in aligning game logic with blockchain state management**.
- **The relative immaturity of gaming-specific tooling in the Polkadot ecosystem**.
- **A focus on DeFi and infrastructure projects rather than user-facing game development frameworks**.
- **A lack of structured onboarding tools for game developers** who are unfamiliar with blockchain paradigms.

#### Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?

At this point, we are not aware of any **comparable projects in other blockchain ecosystems** that offer:

- A **fully on-chain game engine focused on asset state transitions**.
- Direct **Unity integration** with a focus on **traditional game developer workflows**.
- A **local playground environment for rapid prototyping**.

Some ecosystems (like Flow and Immutable X) have focused on **NFT-based game assets**, but these efforts typically **focus on asset minting/trading** rather than **full asset lifecycle management with built-in state progression and game logic integration**.

SAGE represents a **novel approach**, bridging **traditional game design concepts** with **on-chain asset management and game progression**, tailored specifically for Polkadot’s strengths (scalability, composability, and cross-chain compatibility).

## Future Plans

Our major goal is to establish SAGE as a comprehensive onboarding funnel for game developers, streamlining the creation of on-chain gaming projects by leveraging existing tools such as the Polkadot SDK for Unity. In the short term, we will focus on enhancing and promoting the SAGE Framework by migrating current gaming projects—like AAA, BattleMogs, DOT4Gravity, Stardust, Big Ballz of Bajun and others—onto SAGE once it reaches production readiness. Looking ahead, our team envisions further simplifying on-chain game creation by abstracting game logic into a pseudo- or scripting language, enabling strong macros, or by enabling configuration via simple smart contracts. Additionally, we are committed to exploring use cases for SAGE beyond the gaming vertical.
